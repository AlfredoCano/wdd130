        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Our rafting company was founded in 2023 by Alfredo Cano, who had a
          passion for outdoor adventure and a love for the natural beauty of the
          south lakes. Starting with just a few rafts and a small team of
          guides, we began offering guided rafting trips down the "blue river"
          and quickly gained a reputation for providing safe, fun, and memorable
          experiences. Over the years, our company has grown and expanded,
          adding new rivers and destinations to our offerings and increasing our
          fleet of rafts and equipment. We have also expanded our team of guides
          and staff, hiring experienced professionals who share our passion for
          outdoor adventure and commitment to safety and service.
